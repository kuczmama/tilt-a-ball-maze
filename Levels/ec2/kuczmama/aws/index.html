In the css formatting.  I changed the background color of the page.  I also changed all of the basic font colors.  I changed the font color to white and I also changed the link colors to gray.  Then when you hover over the links I make the text change color as well.  I also centered all of the elements in the page, and messed around with the spacing a bit.
